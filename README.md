# simple-poem
A random poem on a bright Saturday (part of Github for Writers Udemy course):

In this moment, invincibility claims me as her own; <br>
knowledge stands proud as I stretch myself <br>
beyound the intellectual horizon <br>
to capture new tools, code my own genesis. <br>
One practice session at a time.
